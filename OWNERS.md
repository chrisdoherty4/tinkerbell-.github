# Owners

This project makes use of [CODEOWNERS files]. The purpose of these files is to
notify and assign the correct teams and individuals to issues related to areas
of the project that they are most familiar with.

The denoted owners for an area of a project may further narrow ownership by file
type or path. These owners should manage additional membership. It is preferable
to assign ownership to many small divisions of Tinkerbell projects, with narrow
areas of concern, than to have many owners ambiguously assigned to govern the
entire Tinkerbell ecosystem or several large projects.

## Expectations

_The expectations below are influenced or directly copied from the [Chromium
Code Reviewers guide]_.

* Demonstrate excellent judgment, teamwork and ability to uphold Tinkerbell
  development principles.

* Be already acting as an owner, providing high-quality reviews and design
  feedback.

* Be a Tinkerbell project member with full commit access to at least one project
  for at least three months tenure.

* Have submitted a substantial number of non-trivial changes to the affected
  directory.

* Have committed or reviewed substantial work to the affected directory within
  the last ninety days.

* Have the bandwidth to contribute to reviews in a timely manner. If the load is
  unsustainable, work to expand the number of owners. Don't try to discourage
  people from sending reviews, including writing “slow” or “emeritus” after your
  name.

These are guidelines more than hard rules, and exceptions are okay as long as
there is a consensus by the existing owners for them. For example,
seldom-updated directories may have exceptions to the “substantiality” and
“recency” requirements.

## Composition and Balance

Each project will benefit from a diversity of owners.

Technical owners may be more comfortable representing and defending the code
quality, performance, test coverage, runtime, and technical road-map.
Site-reliability engineers can provide insight into the direct processes a PR
affects and can call out any effects or side-effects that users may experience.

Owners don't have to be programmers or operators. Owners may call for improved
code comments, or provide and revise documentation. Owners can specialize in
areas of branding, marketing, or they may defends the users, seek to increase
project usage, or strive for future adoption.

Owners can have mixed interests. Our community benefits from owners that
represent a multitude of disciplines.

## Boundaries

Owners should defend and endorse the pull-request policies and the [Tinkerbell
Proposal system].

Pet projects should not be blessed and pushed through without going through the
appropriate community standards for review and discussion.

Owners should strive to exemplify and uphold solid engineering and community
practices with a keen interest in the long-term health of Tinkerbell.
